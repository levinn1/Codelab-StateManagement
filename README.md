State Management in Flutter

State management is essential for building scalable Flutter applications. It ensures efficient handling of app-wide data, such as user authentication and shopping carts, while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

Why Use State Management?

In large apps, managing shared data between widgets can be challenging. Proper state management simplifies:

Sharing app-wide data (e.g., user login status, shopping carts).

Ensuring efficient UI updates.

Keeping code maintainable as the app grows.
